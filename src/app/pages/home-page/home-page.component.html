        We are system security researchers at the
        Pennsylvania State University. We are interested in improving systemsâ€™
        security, reliability, and performance. We have built cutting-edge
        tools that pinpoint thousands of previously unknown bugs and
        vulnerabilities in famous software, and developed robust systems that 
        can effectively and efficiently protect modern software from malicious
        attacks.
