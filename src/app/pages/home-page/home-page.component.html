        <p style="font-size: 1.3rem;">We are system security researchers at the
        Pennsylvania State University. We are interested in improving systemsâ€™
        security, reliability, and performance. We have built cutting-edge
        tools that pinpoint thousands of previously unknown bugs and
        vulnerabilities in famous software, and developed robust systems that 
        can effectively and efficiently protect modern software from malicious
        attacks.

        We always have openings for self-motivated students and interns.
